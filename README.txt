Introduction
============

Written for the Plone Foundation, to allow people to sign up as members, and be
approved by a membership committee.

Note: to use this, you must have the permissions defined in config.py
assigned to people in your site. On plone.org, we also have Foundation
Members only be addable to a single folder, to better manage the
process.
